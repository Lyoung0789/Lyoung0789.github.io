It feels like it was just yesterday, when I first started FlatIron School for Software Engineering, and now it’s almost over! This experience has been amazing! I learned so much over the course of 5 months and to be honest, I'm kinda sad that it's over. I had the absolute best experience, here and I would recommend this program to anyone that wants to learn coding!

Throughout this course I learned Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, SQL, CSS, HTML, Javascript, React, Redux. If you would have asked me 5 months ago to code a simple program in any of these languages I would fail miserably. FlatIron has found the perfect formula to teach their students all of these languages. Each course was broken down into just the right amount of information so you get the understanding of things but also not too much, to overload your brains with too much information. Also, the instructors of this course were super helpful! They were so well educated in each language and wanted you to succeed.

I had an amazing time doing this course, but that doesn't mean it was easy. It was a lot of work! I was a full time student and this course did feel like a full time job and then some. There would be nights of me dreaming in code. Or if I'm doing some chores around the house, a thought of “oh, maybe this would work in my project”, would just come to mind. Sometimes I would be so into a project or a topic that I would lose track of time researching and trying out new ways to code something. The FlatIron community was a great help though. I never felt like I was dumb or ashamed if I didnt know a topic. My cohort had some really intelligent and friendly people in it, that I will remain close friends with!

As this course comes to an end, I will be walking away with so much more knowledge and experience than expecting. I have made some awesome applications while making some pretty great friends. Even though this chapter has come to an end, coding and programming is something that I have to keep up with. I will keep learning new languages and keep honing my skill set to become a better programmer!
